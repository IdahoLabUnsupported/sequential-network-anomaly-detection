## Weird Log
Weird logs are tough to deal with since we do not want to throw a notable everytime there is a bad TCP checksum or 
something (these tokens are incredibly rare and would throw a notable every time).

One field:
- [ ] probably_malicious (a predefined list of weird log behavior that is very likely to be associated with malicious activity)
